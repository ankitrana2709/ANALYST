# ANALYST

We imported the dataset using, pandas library
convert data into pandas dataframe

clean some data ,

# Simple linear regression slr
relationship between predictor and target
y = c + mx
m is slope

we store parameters in numpy array 
each value goes in new row.

other factors also affect which is known
as noise . a small positive or negtive value
are added.

training points to get parameters.
we use these parameters to get a model.

it is a probability


# Multiple Linear Regression(MLR)
One continous target(Y)
two or more predictor(X)

Y = a + bx1 + cx2 + dx3 + ex4

1 extract predictor variables and store them in a variable
z = df[["horsepower", "curb- weight", "engine-size", "highway-mpg"]]

train as before
